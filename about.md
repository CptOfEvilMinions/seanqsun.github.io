## Does this count as doxxing myself?

Currently, I am a senior at the Rochester Institute of Techonlogy studying **Computing Security**. I used to run the <a class="link1" href="https://rc3.club">**RIT's Competitive Cybersecurity Club**</a>, but I'm spending my last year working on personal projects. At heart, I enjoy building organizations and leading teams.

I like cybersecurity in itself, but I love the concept of fusing it with another aspect of our lives. Often you'll find that my creative projects explore cybersecurity both technically and culturally.

## So far, I have worked here:

*  Security Engineer Intern @ CoreOS, Red Hat
    * May 2018 - August 2018
    * Had the unique experience to work in both SF and NYC with two very different teams.
    * SF: Broke things in openshift/console and then fixed thems.
    * NYC: Added an API to openshift/origin to allow group membership reuse.
