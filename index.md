## Is it me you're looking for?

Hi, I'm Sean. I am a freelance **brand identity designer** for cybersecurity companies. I'm here for you from logo design to fully built website.

But during the day, I work as a **security engineer**; which helps a whole lot with the first part. I also, obsessively, work on personal projects to explore different sides of cyberscurity that I can't find on the Internet. I believe my passion is in designing and developing elegant, yet secure digital experiences. Keep up to date with my antics through my <a class="link1" href="https://www.seanqsun.com/blog">blog</a>.

Anwyway, stay awhile, take a look around. You're always welcome.
